        <p>Born and raised in Washington State,it's hard to want to ever leave such a unique place. All around me are mountains and water. What more could you ask for?! This particular shot was taken in the North Cascades, along a ridge called Skyline Divide. It was a rainy day, but as soon as we got up around 7,000 ft, the clouds parted and the sun began to shine through.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3"><h3>Italy</h3>
        <p>Italy was the number one place I wanted to go for my first abroad trip. We took a water taxi into Venice and stayed in a small little hotel next to an incredible pizza place. We wandered around the canals and bridges for days, taking in the antique sites and smells of the incredibly unique and romantic city.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3"><p><h3>Iceland</h3>
        <p>I went to Iceland on a whim with a few of my college friends. We literally bought the tickets and left the next week. Landing in Iceland looked like landing on Mars, it was so vastly different than anywhere I had ever been. We wandered through the icy mountains, the green valleys, the giant waterfalls, and even took a ferry out to a small island in the middle of nowhere.</p>

      <div class="col-md-3"><h3>Spain</h3>
        <p>Walking down the streets of Barcelona, you could hear flamanco music blaring, women in red dresses dancing, street peddlers trying to sell fish, and so much more. We had to et up early to go to the beach because as soon as 9am came around, the whole city was out and about. We ate tapas all day and danced all night.</p>
